## Key Insights
- Bugs dominate new issues at 60.9%, with critical failures in payment, login, and app stability affecting broad user segments and demanding immediate attention.
- Sentiment skews heavily negative, with 11 frustrated reports out of 15 total, signaling escalating user dissatisfaction that could impact retention.
- Resolution efficiency is a concern, as only 15.4% of created tickets were resolved, despite rapid initial responses averaging 0.1 hours.
- Top priorities cluster around core functionality breakdowns, including iOS crashes impacting the entire user base and authentication errors.
- Feature requests remain low at 6, but medium-priority items like API limits suggest opportunities for proactive enhancements.

## Recommendations

## Detailed Summary
The daily metrics for December 4, 2025, indicate a busy period for the support team, with 23 new issues reported, of which 14 were identified as bugs representing 60.9% of the total. Additionally, 6 feature requests were logged, leading to the creation of 13 Jira tickets. However, only 2 tickets were resolved, resulting in a resolution rate of 15.4%. Response times remain a strong point at an average of 0.1 hours, but resolution times averaged 1.2 hours, suggesting delays in the fixing phase that could exacerbate user issues.

Sentiment analysis from the reports shows a concerning distribution: 1 positive, 1 neutral, 2 negative, and a stark 11 frustrated responses. This frustration is echoed in the top priority items, where critical issues like payment processing failures for all credit card transactions and mobile app crashes on iOS 17 affecting the entire user base top the list. High-priority concerns include login errors with 500 authentication failures, data not saving post-logout, broken export functionality, and incorrect search results. Medium-priority items, such as restrictive API rate limits and non-functional comments, round out the priorities, highlighting both immediate crises and longer-term integration challenges.

Overall, these metrics reveal patterns of systemic bugs undermining core user experiences, driving frustration and potentially harming product adoption. While quick responses demonstrate effective initial triage, the low resolution rate underscores the need for enhanced engineering throughput. Addressing the critical items promptly could stabilize user sentiment, and tracking these trends will be essential for future improvements in product reliability and support efficiency.
