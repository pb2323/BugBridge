## Detailed Summary
The daily metrics for December 4, 2025, show a busy day for the support team, with 23 new issues reported, including 14 bugs (60.9%), 6 feature requests, and the creation of 13 Jira tickets. Only 2 tickets were resolved, resulting in a 15.4% resolution rate. Response times remain strong at an average of 0.1 hours, but resolution times averaged 1.2 hours, suggesting that while initial acknowledgments are swift, full fixes are taking longer.

Sentiment distribution underscores user challenges, with 11 frustrated reports dominating the 15 total feedbacks (1 positive, 1 neutral, 2 negative, and 11 frustrated). This indicates widespread dissatisfaction, particularly around functionality breakdowns. Top priority items include critical failures in payment processing for credit cards and mobile app crashes on iOS 17, which affect the entire user base, alongside high-priority issues like login errors and data loss.

Other notable concerns involve export functionality, search inaccuracies, and API rate limits, with medium priorities like non-functional comments. These patterns highlight the need for focused efforts on core stability to rebuild user trust. Overall, while operational efficiency in responses is a positive, the low resolution rate and negative sentiment signal opportunities for process improvements to mitigate escalating frustrations.
