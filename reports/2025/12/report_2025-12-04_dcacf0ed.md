## Detailed Summary
The daily metrics for December 4, 2025, indicate a busy day for the support and product teams, with 23 new issues reported, of which 14 were identified as bugs representing 60.9% of the total. Additionally, 6 feature requests were logged, highlighting user desires for enhancements amid ongoing challenges. The team created 13 Jira tickets to address these, but only managed to resolve 2, resulting in a resolution rate of 15.4%. Response times remain a strong point at an average of 0.1 hours, demonstrating efficient initial triage, while average resolution time stood at 1.2 hours, suggesting potential delays in deeper fixes.

Sentiment analysis from the 15 categorized feedbacks reveals concerning trends: only 1 positive and 1 neutral response, overshadowed by 2 negative and a stark 11 frustrated sentiments. This distribution underscores widespread user discontent, particularly driven by critical issues. The top priority items include several high-impact problems: payment processing failures for all credit card transactions (critical), mobile app crashes on iOS 17 affecting the entire user base (critical), and login errors yielding 500 authentication failures (high). Other high-priority concerns encompass data not saving post-logout, corrupted export downloads, incorrect search results, and user expressions of extreme disappointment with recent updates rendering the app unusable. Medium priorities like restrictive API rate limits and non-functional comments round out the list, indicating a mix of immediate crises and longer-term improvements.

Overall, these metrics point to a product under strain from foundational bugs that erode user trust, as evidenced by the frustration-heavy sentiment. While quick responses help maintain engagement, the low resolution rate risks compounding issues and amplifying negative perceptions. Addressing the critical and high-priority items swiftly is essential to stabilize core functionalities and restore confidence, with data-driven interventions poised to drive better outcomes in subsequent days.
