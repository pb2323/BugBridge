## Key Insights
- Bugs constitute the majority of issues (14 out of 23, or 60.9%), with critical ones like payment failures and app crashes threatening user retention and revenue.
- Sentiment skews heavily negative, with 11 frustrated reports out of 15 total, indicating widespread dissatisfaction that could escalate if unaddressed.
- Resolution rate is low at 15.4%, despite rapid response times (0.1 hours average), suggesting resource constraints or complexity in bug fixes.
- Top priorities cluster around core functionalities (payment, login, data saving), affecting a broad user base and requiring immediate attention.
- Feature requests (6) are minimal compared to issues, but API limits and export bugs point to integration and usability pain points.

## Recommendations
- Escalate critical items (payment processing, iOS crashes, login errors) to engineering leads for same-day triage and resolution to mitigate user churn.
- Conduct a root cause analysis on recurring bugs, such as data saving and export issues, to prevent future occurrences and improve overall product stability.
- Increase resource allocation to resolution processes, targeting a higher resolution rate by prioritizing high-impact tickets over new intakes.
- Implement sentiment monitoring alerts for frustrated feedback to enable proactive outreach and gather more qualitative data on user pain points.

## Detailed Summary
The daily metrics for December 4, 2025, reveal a challenging day for customer support, with 23 new issues reported, of which 14 were identified as bugs representing 60.9% of the total. This includes 6 feature requests, leading to the creation of 13 Jira tickets. However, only 2 tickets were resolved, resulting in a modest 15.4% resolution rate. Response times averaged an efficient 0.1 hours, but resolution times stretched to 1.2 hours on average, underscoring a gap between initial engagement and full fixes.

Sentiment distribution among the 15 analyzed feedbacks shows a concerning trend: only 1 positive and 1 neutral, overshadowed by 2 negative and a dominant 11 frustrated responses. This frustration is echoed in the top priority items, where critical issues like payment processing failures for all credit card transactions and mobile app crashes on iOS 17 impact the entire user base. High-priority concerns include login errors (500 authentication failures), data not saving post-logout, broken export functionality, and incorrect search results, all contributing to user dissatisfaction. Medium priorities, such as restrictive API rate limits and non-functional comments, further highlight integration and feature reliability gaps.

Overall, these metrics indicate a product under strain from foundational bugs, with user patience wearing thin as evidenced by comments like 'This is ridiculous - losing patience with constant bugs' and 'Extremely disappointed with recent update - app is now unusable.' While the low response time demonstrates strong support responsiveness, the low resolution rate and negative sentiment necessitate urgent action to restore trust and functionality. Addressing these priorities could prevent escalation and support long-term user satisfaction.
